This is the Unit Sphere normalized version of person.obj.

Each vertex is transformed as:

𝑥
′
=
𝑥
−
𝜇
𝑟
𝑚
𝑎
𝑥
x
′
=
r
max
	​

x−μ
	​


where

𝜇
μ = centroid (mean of all vertices)

𝑟
𝑚
𝑎
𝑥
r
max
	​

 = farthest vertex distance from the centroid

This maps the entire mesh inside a sphere of radius 1, centered at the origin (0, 0, 0).

🔹 Example

If the farthest vertex from the centroid is 20 units away,
then after normalization, all vertices are scaled such that:

distance_from_centroid ≤ 1

🔹 Purpose

This method is scale-invariant and rotation-stable, making it excellent for comparing or learning from meshes of different dimensions.

🔹 Visualization

You can verify by plotting:

import open3d as o3d
pcd = o3d.io.read_point_cloud("outputs/normalized/person_unitsphere.ply")
o3d.visualization.draw_geometries([pcd])


You’ll notice that the mesh appears “centered” — its center lies near (0, 0, 0).

⚙️ How They’re Generated

When you run:

python src/mesh_pipeline.py data/ outputs/


Your code:

Reads the vertices from data/person.obj

Applies:

Min–Max Normalization

Unit Sphere Normalization

Saves them into:

outputs/normalized/person_minmax.ply
outputs/normalized/person_unitsphere.ply
