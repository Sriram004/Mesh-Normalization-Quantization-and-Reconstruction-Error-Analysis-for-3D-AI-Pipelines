Each vertex (x, y, z) has been transformed using:

This maps every axis into the range [0, 1], ensuring a consistent coordinate scale across all meshes.

🔹 Example

If your original mesh coordinates were:

x ∈ [-12.4, 15.7]
y ∈ [-8.2, 9.1]
z ∈ [0.0, 24.3]


then after Min–Max normalization:

x', y', z' ∈ [0, 1]


Now the mesh fits neatly inside a unit cube.

🔹 Purpose

This ensures scale consistency between meshes of different sizes — ideal for models or pipelines that expect normalized data (like SeamGPT).

import open3d as o3d
mesh = o3d.io.read_point_cloud("outputs/normalized/person_minmax.ply")
o3d.visualization.draw_geometries([mesh])
