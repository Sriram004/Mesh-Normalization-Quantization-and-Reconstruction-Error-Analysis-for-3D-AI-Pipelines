This file is generated by quantizing the Min–Max normalized mesh (person_minmax.ply).

Each coordinate 
𝑥
′
x
′
 in the range [0, 1] is transformed using:

𝑞
=
int
(
𝑥
′
×
(
𝑛
𝑏
𝑖
𝑛
𝑠
−
1
)
)
q=int(x
′
×(n
bins
	​

−1))

where 
𝑛
𝑏
𝑖
𝑛
𝑠
=
1024
n
bins
	​

=1024

This converts every floating-point value into one of 1024 discrete integer levels (0–1023).

🔹 Example
Original (normalized)	Quantized (integer bin)
0.000	0
0.321	328
0.754	771
1.000	1023

These integers are then mapped back to floating-point when you visualize the quantized mesh.

🔹 Purpose

Compression: reduces precision → smaller data representation

Uniform resolution: all coordinates share the same bin size

AI-friendly representation: makes data discretized for embedding or neural encoding
